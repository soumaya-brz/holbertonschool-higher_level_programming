# Python - Serialization

This project explores marshaling and serialization, key techniques for storing and transmitting data efficiently. You will learn how to convert Python objects into formats like JSON or binary, save them to files, and reload them while preserving their state. The project focuses on practical applications, helping you understand data persistence, sharing between programs, and network communication. By completing it, you'll gain hands-on experience in handling serialized data in real-world scenarios.
