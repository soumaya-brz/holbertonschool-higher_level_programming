# RESTful API Project

This project focuses on learning how to consume and build RESTful APIs.  
It covers the basics of HTTP/HTTPS, using `curl` and Python to fetch data, creating simple APIs with Python's `http.server`, and handling JSON responses.  

The goal is to understand how clients and servers communicate over HTTP and how to structure basic API endpoints for data retrieval and status checks.
