Abstract Classes, Interfaces & Subclassing (Python)

This project introduces advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python. It focuses on how to design clean, reusable, and well-structured code using abstraction and inheritance.

Concepts covered

Abstract classes and the abc module

Interfaces and duck typing

Subclassing built-in Python classes

Method overriding

Multiple inheritance

Mixins

Objectives

The goal is to understand how to enforce class contracts, share behavior between classes, and extend existing classes while respecting OOP principles.

All exercises are written in Python 3 and follow best practices for readability and maintainability.
